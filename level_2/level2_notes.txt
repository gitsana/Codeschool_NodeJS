Events
--------------------------------

DOM triggers event, you can listen for those events (click, submit, hover)

- objects in node also emit events, and if they do, they inherit from the EventEmitter constructor
- net.Server class inherits from it, emits the request event
- fs.readStream, returns a stream which inherits from event emitter, emits the data event

- custom event emitter created "logger" (in 'events.js')
